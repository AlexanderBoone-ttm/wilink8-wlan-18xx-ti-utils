1. BINARY FILE VALIDITY CHECKS
------------------------------

The binary file contains 3 values that are used for validity and
corruption checks: magic, version and checksum.

1.1. Conf file with valid magic number

     Make sure the input file (test-1.1-conf.bin) contains
     0x10e100ca in its first 4 bytes and run:

	./wlconf -g header.magic -i tests/test-1.1-conf.bin

     Expected result: the tool returns the value of header.conf and it
     is 0x10e100ca.

1.2 Conf file with invalid magic number

     Make sure the input file (test-1.2-conf.bin) contains
     0xffffffff in its first 4 bytes and run:

	./wlconf -g header.magic -i tests/test-1.2-conf.bin

     Expected result: the tool should reject the file and print an
     error.
