1. BINARY FILE VALIDITY CHECKS
------------------------------

The binary file contains 3 values that are used for validity and
corruption checks: magic, version and checksum.

1.1. Conf file with valid header values

     Make sure the input file (test-1.1-conf.bin) contains
     0x10e100ca in its first 4 bytes, then 4 bytes with the correct
     version number for the current struct (eg. 0x00010001), then a
     correctly calculated CRC32 checksum and run:

	./wlconf -g header.magic -i tests/test-1.1-conf.bin

     Expected result: the tool returns the value of header.conf and it
     is 0x10e100ca.

1.2 Conf file with invalid magic number

     Make sure the input file (test-1.2-conf.bin) contains
     0xffffffff at bytes 0-3 and run:

	./wlconf -g header.magic -i tests/test-1.2-conf.bin

     Expected result: the tool should reject the file and print an
     error.

1.3 Conf file with invalid version number

     Make sure the input file (test-1.3-conf.bin) contains
     0xffffffff at bytes 4-7 and run:

	./wlconf -g header.magic -i tests/test-1.3-conf.bin

     Expected result: the tool should reject the file and print an
     error.

1.4 Conf file with invalid checksum

     Make sure the input file (test-1.4-conf.bin) contains
     0xffffffff at bytes 8-11 and run:

	./wlconf -g header.magic -i tests/test-1.4-conf.bin

     Expected result: the tool should reject the file and print an
     error.

1.5 Generate correct checksum when changing a value

    Run the following command:

	./wlconf -s wl18xx.phy.rdl=0xff -i tests/test-1.5-conf.bin -o tests/result-1.5-conf.bin

    Then read the value with:

	./wlconf -g wl18xx.phy.rdl -i tests/result-1.5-conf.bin

    Expected result: the tool should be able to read the new value
    (0xff) without reporting binary corruption. (Note: this test
    depends on the success of test 1.4).

1.6 Ignore invalid checksum from conf file

     Make sure the input file (test-1.6-conf.bin) contains
     0xffffffff at bytes 8-11 and run:

	./wlconf -g header.magic -i tests/test-1.6-conf.bin -X

     Expected result:  the tool should be able to read the value and
     print it out (0x10e100ca).
